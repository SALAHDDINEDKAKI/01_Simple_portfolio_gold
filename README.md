# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio project I built by following a YouTube tutorial by [Under Ctrl](https://youtu.be/Slxdo0Dqxlk). The purpose of this project is to practice and improve my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> I do not claim full ownership of the design or concept â€” this was built for learning purposes.
